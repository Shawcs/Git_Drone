## Introduction

1 First init of the project

1. write the `README.md`
2. Define the hardware
3. Match it with a programming language and guide line
4. Get a physical model of the drone (with the principal components and the electronic cards)
5. CODE !!!
6. Test the code
7. Run it
8. live test

##technical specification of the project 

- The drone must be autonomous. We cannot send flight command after the take off

- The only human action is to send the GO signal to notify the drone that he can proceed to his goal

- The purpose of the drone is to take off from a point A in order to reach a point B. All by his own way.

- The goal point B will be defined by the operator. He is completely mobile in the space. But once the point is determined you cannot move it during the drone flight.

- The B point will be a sort of electronic balise (for the moment we do not know what it will be composed of, but we will have a physical object)

- The length between A and B must be included into 0 and 1 000 meter

- The precision of the landing near the tag can be up to 1 meter. This is our precision tolerance.

- We will not use any autopilot or pré built flight controller

- The drone will evolve in an outdoor, clear area. That mean no wall and no construction but we cn face moving people or trees. 

- Concerning autonomous we plan to get something around 15 or 20 minutes. This is not our main problem, so we will not focus on energy consumpsion first.
